---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (v1.8.x or later)
- Compatible sensor hardware (ESP8266, MPU6050)
- Modern web browser
- USB cable for ESP8266 connection to your computer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sidd-Patel/PostureGuard.git](https://github.com/Sidd-Patel/PostureGuard.git)
    cd PostureGuard
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies (Arduino Libraries):**
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...
    - Search for and install the following libraries:
      - ESP8266WiFi by ESP8266 Community
      - ESP8266WebServer by ESP8266 Community
      - Adafruit MPU6050 Library by Adafruit
      - Adafruit Unified Sensor Library by Adafruit
    - Close the Library Manager.
3.  **Hardware Setup:**
    - Connect the MPU6050 sensor to the ESP8266 according to the wiring diagram provided in the documentation (or within the .ino file comments).
    - Common connections include:
      - MPU6050 VCC to ESP8266 3.3V
      - MPU6050 GND to ESP8266 GND
      - MPU6050 SDA to ESP8266 D2 (or SDA pin)
      - MPU6050 SCL to ESP8266 D1 (or SCL pin)
4.  **Upload Firmware:**
    - Open the PostureGuard.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
    - Go to Tools > Board > ESP8266 Boards (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)).
    - Go to Tools > Port and select the COM port (Windows) or /dev/tty.* (macOS/Linux) corresponding to your ESP8266.
    - Click the Upload button (right arrow) to flash the code to your ESP8266.
    - Wait for the upload to complete.
5.  **Connect to the ESP8266 Access Point:**
    - After the ESP8266 restarts, it will create a Wi-Fi access point.
    - Use a Wi-Fi-enabled device (computer, smartphone) to connect to the network named "PostureGuardAP" (or whatever name you set in the .ino file).
    - Open a web browser and navigate to 192.168.4.1 (the default IP address of the ESP8266 access point).
6.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    - The PostureGuard web dashboard should load in your browser, displaying real-time sensor data.

## üîß Usage Tips

- **Calibration:** For optimal results, calibrate the system while maintaining your ideal posture. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate smoothly.
- **Mode Switching:** Use "Normal Mode" for desk work and "Activity Mode" during physical exercises to avoid false alerts.
- **Threshold Adjustments:** Customize sensitivity thresholds to suit your comfort and requirements.
- **Mobile Integration:** The dashboard features a responsive design, ensuring seamless access and monitoring on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Connect to the ESP8266 Access Point and monitor your posture in real time via your browser.

## üîç How It Works

1.  **Sensor Data Collection:** The MPU6050 sensor continuously gathers data.
2.  **Data Processing:** The ESP8266 computes posture angle (using custom Z-axis remapping), pitch, and roll using advanced algorithms.
3.  **Smart Filtering:** The system differentiates between poor posture and intentional movement using filtering algorithms.
4.  **Real-Time Feedback:** AJAX is used to update the dashboard every 500ms, providing instant feedback.
