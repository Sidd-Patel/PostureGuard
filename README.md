# PostureGuard  
*An innovative smart posture tracking system that protects your health in real time*  

---

üìã **Overview**  
PostureGuard is a cutting-edge posture monitoring system that uses wearable sensor technology and a dynamic web dashboard to help you maintain proper posture‚Äîwhether you're at your desk or on the move. It intelligently distinguishes between intentional movements and poor posture, providing immediate, actionable feedback to prevent musculoskeletal issues.

‚ú® **Key Features**  
- **Dual-Mode Operation:**  
  - **Normal Mode:** Strict monitoring for sedentary activities.  
  - **Activity Mode:** Flexible monitoring during physical activities to avoid false alerts.
- **Intelligent Detection:**  
  - Differentiates between intentional movements and poor posture.  
  - Tracks the duration of poor posture for timely corrective feedback.
- **Personalized Calibration:**  
  - Quickly calibrate to your ideal posture baseline.  
  - Customizable sensitivity thresholds for a tailored experience.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:**  
  - Live tracking of posture angle, pitch, roll, accelerometer, and gyroscope data.  
  - Interactive dashboard with historical trend analysis.

üñ•Ô∏è **Technical Details**  
- **Built With:**  
  - **Firmware:** Arduino (C++) running on an ESP8266  
  - **Web Dashboard:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (AJAX for real-time updates)  
  - **Sensor Integration:** MPU6050 (accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature sensor)
- **Key Algorithms:**  
  - Calculation of Posture Angle using Z-axis remapping (i.e., -9.8 m/s¬≤ ‚Üí +90¬∞, 9.8 m/s¬≤ ‚Üí -90¬∞)  
  - Computation of Pitch & Roll using trigonometric formulas  
  - Smart filtering to differentiate between poor posture and exercise

üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites  
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (v1.8.x or later)  
- Compatible sensor hardware (ESP8266, MPU6050)  
- Modern web browser

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sidd-Patel/PostureGuard.git
cd PostureGuard

# 2. Install Dependencies:
# - Open the Arduino IDE and install the following libraries via the Library Manager:
#   - ESP8266WiFi
#   - ESP8266WebServer
#   - Adafruit MPU6050
#   - Adafruit Sensor

# 3. Upload Firmware:
# - Open the main .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
# - Select your ESP8266 board (e.g., NodeMCU).
# - Upload the code to your device.

# 4. Hardware Setup:
# - Connect the MPU6050 sensor to the ESP8266 as per the wiring diagram provided in the docs.
# - Power up the system; the ESP8266 will automatically start in Access Point mode.
